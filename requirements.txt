# This file contains all the required packages for the course
# You don't need to install it, but it's here as a convenience.
# Many sample projects have their own requirements.txt files
# and sometimes instructions suggest you use pip to install a library
# But if you want to avoid those steps and you use a single virtual
# environment for the course, just install this via:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# In your terminal with the environment activated.
